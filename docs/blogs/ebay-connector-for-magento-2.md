### Installation Of eBay Connector for Magento 2

Customers will get a **zip folder** and they have to extract the contents of this zip folder on their system. Thus, the extracted folder has an ** src** folder, inside the src folder you have the **app** folder.

You need to transfer this **app** folder into the Magento2 root directory on the server as shown below.

![magento2-folder-structure](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/magento2-folder-structure.webp)

If you download the module from Magento Connect then unzip the respective extension zip.

Henceforth create **Webkul**(vendor) then **Ebaymagentoconnect**(module) name folder inside your magento2 root directory as:

**app/code/Webkul/Ebaymagentoconnect** and then move all module’s files inside **/app/code/Webkul/Ebaymagentoconnect/** folder in magento2 root directory.

![ebay-magento-connector-folder-structure](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/ebay-magento-connector-folder-structure.webp)

After the upload, you can see the folders in your Magento2 Root Directory.

![ebay-magento-connector-folder-struscture](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/ebay-magento-connector-folder-struscture.webp)

Hereafter the successful installation, you have to run these commands in the Magento2 root directory.

```
composer require webkul/ebayconnector
```

```
php bin/magento setup:upgrade
```

```
php bin/magento setup:di:compile
```

```
php bin/magento setup:static-content:deploy
```

```
php bin/magento indexer:reindex
```

```
php bin/magento cache:flush
```

**Note- “composer require webkul/ebayconnector”** this command is necessary to run in the terminal for the proper installation of the module.

### Multilingual Support

For **multilingual **support, the admin will navigate through **Store->Configuration->General ->Locale Options.**

Hence, select the locale as German (the language into which the admin wants to translate his store content).

![magento2-german-admin-configuration-locale](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/magento2-german-admin-configuration-locale.webp)

### Translation Of eBay Connector for Magento 2

If a user wants to translate their module from English to German. Henceforth, they need to follow the path **app/code/Webkul/Ebaymagentoconnect/i18n** in their unzip Magento2 Ebaymagentoconnect folder.

The user receives a CSV file with the name “en_US.csv”. Now they will rename that CSV as “de_DE.csv”.

Then translate all right side content after the comma in the German language.

After editing the CSV, save it and then upload it to the path **app/code/Webkul/Ebaymagentoconnect/i18n** where the Magento2 on the server installation took place.

So, the module will translate into the German Language. However, it supports both **RTL **and **LTR **languages.

![ebay-magento-connector-multi-language-csv](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/ebay-magento-connector-multi-language-csv.webp)

![multi-language-csv](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/multi-language-csv.webp)

Thus, the user can edit the CSV like the image below.

### eBay Connector for Magento2 Configuration

### How to get eBay Connector credentials?

After the successful installation of Magento 2 ebay integration module, one will need to fill in the eBay developer keys **(app id, cert id, dev id, user id, auth token**).

Thus, the eBay account has these credentials.

However, if the user doesn’t have an account, then the user will have to create an account and get the required keys.

#### **First Step**

To create a new account go to [**developer.ebay.com**](https://developer.ebay.com) and click on the **sign-in/Join link**.

![Sign-Up](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Sign-Up.png)

#### **Second Step**

Now, create a **username** and **password** for your account and then click the **join** button.  
![Register- eBay Connector for Magento2](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Register.png)

#### Third Step

After the above step, you need to create an app. Enter the **app name** and choose the **environment** to generate your **key set**.

So, keep a note that when you generate the keys set then only the app saves.

![eBay Connector for Magento 2](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/App-name.png)

#### **Fourth Step**

So, after clicking on the **Create a Keyset** link(for the environment you choose), you need to confirm the primary contact for this account first.

Henceforth you can click the **Continue to Create Keys** button.  
![confirm-primary-Account eBay Connector for Magento2](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/confirm-primary-Account-1.png)

#### Fifth Step

Now you can see the environment key that you select. Thus, for creating the production keys just click on the “**Create a Key Set**” and you will get your production keys.  
![Sandbox-keys-eBay Connector for Magento2](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Sandbox-keys.png)

#### **Sixth Step**

Thus, for generating the **User Token** go to your **Application keys page**. Hence, in the **App ID** row of the Sandbox keyset, click the **User Tokens** to access the Tokens page for your Sandbox keyset.  
![image](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Sandbox-keys-1.png)

#### Seventh ** Step**

After you click on **“User Tokens”** in the snapshot above, you will see a “**Sign in to Sandbox**” button. Hence, click it to access the sandbox account.  
![image](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Sign-In-Sandbox.png)

So, from here, the user can even get an ‘**eBay Oauth Key**‘ which they can add to **Default Business Policy**.

![User-Tokens-eBay-Sign-In-eBay-1-1](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/User-Tokens-eBay-Sign-In-eBay-1-1.png)

Here, the ‘*sjohn_smith-johnsmit-john-laitazrqx*‘ is the RuName of the application that will be part of the admin configuration.

Additionally, the Your privacy policy URL, auth accepted URL and auth declined URL- will have the frontend URL of the website.

**Your auth accepted URL:** This field is the most important. It should be set as shown below-

https://**domainname**/ebaymagentoconnect/index/fetchtoken

#### **Eighth** Step

Now, enter your Sandbox **Username** and **Password**.  
![image](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/login-sandbox.png)

#### Ninth Step

Hence, after clicking the “**Sign in**” button, you will see another page where you have to click the “**Agree**” button.

![image](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Agree.png)

#### Tenth Step

Lastly, you will redirect back and will get the **App Token**.

After importing all the eBay categories you need to map them to store categories.

At the time of mapping, eBay Condition, and Specification will be created as product attributes and eBay variations will be created as Super Attributes (used for configurable products) in Magento 2.

The admin can map category, under the **eBay Magento Connector > Map Category** option like the image below.

![Mapped-Categories-List-eBay-Magento-Connect-Magento-Admin-3](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Mapped-Categories-List-eBay-Magento-Connect-Magento-Admin-3.png)

![image](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Category-Mapping.png)

**Note:**  If the admin has created any store on the eBay then, an additional field **“eBay Store Category”** will be visible. Thus, for that store, you might have created certain custom categories also.

This **“eBay Store Category”** field will display those custom categories for mapping.

![mapping](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Map-Category.png)

### Category Automation - eBay Connector for Magento2

The **Category Automation** feature under **eBay Magento Connect > Category Automation** lets the admin fetch real-time eBay categories and automatically create the matching Magento category hierarchy, then map selected leaf categories to eBay without manual one-by-one mapping.

![eBay Category Automation](https://gitgitmunassir.github.io/ebay-magento-connector/images/CategoriesUpdatedFeature/CategoryAutomation.png)

***Search Filters Fields-***

- **eBay Parent Category** – Filter the category list by a specific eBay parent category, or choose **All Categories** to browse the full taxonomy.

![eBay Category Automation Listing](https://gitgitmunassir.github.io/ebay-magento-connector/images/CategoriesUpdatedFeature/CategoryAutomationListing.png)

After loading categories, the admin can filter by parent category (for example, **Dolls & Bears**), review the full category path for each row, and select the leaf categories to automate. Pagination and rows-per-page controls help navigate large category trees.

![eBay Category Automation Results](https://gitgitmunassir.github.io/ebay-magento-connector/images/CategoriesUpdatedFeature/CategoryAutomationMappingAndCreation.png)

When automation completes, a summary popup displays the results:

- **Created** – Number of new Magento categories created from the eBay hierarchy.
- **Reused** – Number of existing Magento categories reused when the same name already exists under the parent.
- **Mapped** – Number of eBay categories successfully mapped to Magento categories.
- **Skipped** – Number of categories skipped (for example, when metadata is unavailable).
- **Conflicts** – Number of mapping conflicts encountered during the run.

**Note:** Only **leaf** eBay categories can be selected for automation, since product listings are assigned to terminal categories in the eBay taxonomy.

### Map Product

The admin can synchronize its products on both the stores with the help of this eBay connector extension.

Admin can import products from ebay to Magento 2 and from Magento 2 to ebay.

So, given below are the steps for Product Mapping.

### 1. Import Product from eBay

Navigate to **eBay Magento Connect > Map Product**. From the **Sync From eBay** dropdown, select **Import Product From eBay** to fetch product data from eBay and store it in the Magento database.

![Map Product Sync From eBay Options](https://gitgitmunassir.github.io/ebay-magento-connector/images/ProductImportUpdatedFeature/ProductImportOptions.png)

The **Sync From eBay** menu provides the following product sync actions:

- Import Product From eBay
- Run eBay Product Profiler
- Run eBay Product Image Profiler
- Export To eBay
- Migrate Listing By ID

After clicking **Import Product From eBay**, the following pop-up window will appear.

![Import Product From eBay Popup](https://gitgitmunassir.github.io/ebay-magento-connector/images/ProductImportUpdatedFeature/ImportProductPopup.png)

***Import Fields-***

- **End Date From** – Specifies the earliest (oldest) date to use in a date range filter based on item end time. Each of the time ranges must be a value less than 120 days.
- **End Date To** – Specifies the latest (most recent) date to use in a date range filter based on item end time. Must be specified if End Date From is specified.
- **SKUs (comma separated)** – Optional: enter one or more eBay SKUs separated by commas (e.g. `24-WB04,24-WB06`) to import only those listings. If left blank, products are imported using current pagination logic (all products).
- **Import Only eBay Active Products** – When checked, only actively listed eBay products are imported.

Hence, click the **Import Product From eBay** button as visible in the screenshot above.

![image](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Mapped-Products-List-eBay-Magento-Connect-Magento-Admin.png)

When the admin will click on “Import Product from eBay”, the product data will be created and stored in Magento 2 database.

![image](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/ebay-1.png)

#### Bulk Migrate Listing

From the **Sync From eBay** dropdown, select **Migrate Listing By ID** to migrate specific eBay listings into the Inventory API using their listing IDs.

![Bulk Migrate Listing](https://gitgitmunassir.github.io/ebay-magento-connector/images/ProductImportUpdatedFeature/BulkMigrateListing.png)

***Fields-***

- **Listing ID(s)** – Enter one listing ID or up to 5 comma-separated listing IDs per request.
- **Migrate** – Submits the bulk migration request to eBay via the Sell Inventory API. A confirmation message displays the status for each listing ID after processing.

**Note:** Bulk migrate is useful when you need to import or migrate specific eBay listings by ID rather than using the date-range or SKU-based import in step 1.

### 2. Run eBay Product Profiler

You need to run the product profiler in order to create product entry in the Magento 2 catalog.

Hereafter completing the product profiler process, the imported products will be visible on the storefront immediately.

![Ebay-Connector-blog-2](https://gitgitmunassir.github.io/ebay-magento-connector/images/ProductImportUpdatedFeature/eBayProductProfiler-1.png)

Hence, when the admin will click on **Run eBay Product Profiler. **Henceforth the products will be created on Magento 2 store from Magento 2 Database (synchronized from eBay).

![eBay Connector for Magento 2](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/download-3-.png)

### 3. Run eBay product Image profiler

Now you can run the product image profiler to import the product images in Magento 2.

![Ebay-Connector-blog-6](https://gitgitmunassir.github.io/ebay-magento-connector/images/ProductImportUpdatedFeature/EbayProductImageProfiler.png)

Now, after running the profiler the imported product image will get displayed on the storefront. Hence the Images of the product will be created on Magento 2 store.

### 4. Export Product to eBay

Click on Export to eBay to export products from Magento 2 to ebay.

### ![Ebay-Connector-blog-3](https://gitgitmunassir.github.io/ebay-magento-connector/images/ProductImportUpdatedFeature/ExportProductToEbay.png)

After clicking the **Export to eBay**, the admin will see a **pop-up** window.

Here, the admin can **export all of the products** (only visible products) to eBay by keeping the ** Product SKU** field **empty.**

So, the admin can even **export a single product** by entering the **SKU of the product. **Henceforth clicking on the **Export Product To eBay** button.

***Note-*** Here visible products mean those products whose visibility is set as catalog, search; only catalog, or only search.

However, the products whose visibility is set as Not Visible Individually will not be exported.

![image](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/export-product-sku-1.png)After clicking the “**Export Product to eBay**“, you will see the below screen. Now, when the ** synchronization** is complete you can see the total number of products synced to eBay.

![exporting message-eBay Connector for Magento2](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/exporting-message.png)

### **Export Via Catalog Product Grid**

The admin can now export the products via the product grid in the admin panel. Thus, the admin can check the products for export.

Then in action, the admin can select **Export to eBay.**

![catalog_export_product_eBay Connector for Magento2](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/catalog_export_product.png)

When products are exported to eBay — whether from **Map Product**, the **Catalog Product Grid**, or via **Automatic Product Export** — they are added to an export queue and processed in the background. The admin does not need to wait on the page; export status can be tracked from the **Export Queue Log** and **Bulk Export Tasks** screens under **eBay Magento Connect**.

### Export Queue Log

Navigate to **eBay Magento Connect > Export Queue Log** to monitor the status of each queued product export.

![Export Queue Log](https://gitgitmunassir.github.io/ebay-magento-connector/images/ExportProductRelatedImages/ExportQueueLog.png)

***Grid Columns-***

- **ID** – Unique queue log record ID.
- **Product SKU** – SKU of the product being exported.
- **Product Name** – Name of the product being exported.
- **Status** – Current export status: **Pending**, **Success**, or **Failed**.
- **eBay Item ID** – The eBay listing ID assigned after a successful export.
- **Error Message** – Error details when an export fails.
- **Attempts** – Number of times the export has been attempted.
- **Bulk Task ID** – Links the queue entry to a bulk export task when exported via the Feed API.
- **Created At / Updated At** – Timestamps for when the export was queued and last updated.

***Mass Actions-***

- **Retry Export** – Re-queues selected failed or pending exports for another attempt.
- **Delete** – Removes selected log records from the queue log.

**Note:** Products remain in **Pending** status until the background cron or message queue consumer processes them. Once complete, the status updates to **Success** with the eBay Item ID, or **Failed** with an error message.

### Bulk Export Tasks

When **Use Bulk Feed API** is enabled under **Automatic Product Export To eBay**, products are exported in batches via the eBay Sell Feed API (`LMS_ADD_FIXED_PRICE_ITEM`). Navigate to **eBay Magento Connect > Bulk Export Tasks** to monitor these background batch jobs.

![Bulk Export Tasks](https://gitgitmunassir.github.io/ebay-magento-connector/images/ExportProductRelatedImages/BulkExportTask.png)

***Grid Columns-***

- **ID** – Internal bulk export task ID.
- **eBay Task ID** – Task identifier returned by the eBay Feed API.
- **Feed Type** – The feed operation type (e.g. `LMS_ADD_FIXED_PRICE_ITEM` for adding fixed-price listings).
- **Status** – Batch processing status: **Created**, **Uploaded**, **In Process**, **Completed**, **Completed With Errors**, or **Failed**.
- **Total Items** – Total number of products included in the batch.
- **Success** – Number of products successfully exported in the batch.
- **Failures** – Number of products that failed during the batch export.
- **Error Message** – Error details when the batch task fails.
- **Result File** – Download link for the eBay result file once processing is complete.
- **Created At / Updated At** – Timestamps for when the batch was created and last polled.

Bulk export tasks are created automatically by the **Bulk Export Products** cron. A separate **Bulk Export Poll Results** cron polls eBay for task completion, updates individual **Export Queue Log** entries, and makes the result file available for download.

**Note:** For large catalogs, bulk export processes products in configurable batch sizes (see **Bulk Feed Batch Size** under Automatic Product Export settings). Individual product exports via the message queue appear in **Export Queue Log** without a Bulk Task ID.

### **eBay Product Information**

Please make sure you have provided all the necessary information for the exported products.

However, you will need to mention ** eBay specifications, conditions, and variations** (if any) in Magento products.

![eBay-Product-Visible- eBay Connector for Magento2](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/eBay-Product-Visible.png)

**Please Note: **

- The product information like product name, images, price, description/content, and quantity can easily be Imported or Exported while product mapping on both stores.
- Also, the Magento 2 eBay connector can synchronize product images for Simple as well as Configurable products.

Hereafter exporting products to eBay, the admin can check the **eBay store category** to which the product has been assigned as per the category mapping.

For example, the admin has mapped his Magento 2 **store category**(having cameras) to eBay’s **Camera & Photo **> **Camcorders** sub-category.

Now, after the admin **exports** his product to **eBay **he can edit the imported product on eBay to check the product’s **eBay store category** according to the **mapping**.

![eBay-Product-Visible-eBay Connector for Magento2](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Product-Detail-Category.png)

### Bulk Action- Assign Categories

The admin can assign the categories in bulk to the products that were imported from eBay.

Herein, the admin needs to select the product and from the ‘Action’ dropdown can select the Assign To Category option.

Thus, this option will have a collection of Magento Categories that can be assigned.

![Assign-Category_eBay Connector for Magento2](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Assign-Category.png)

### Listing Templates

The admin can add the listing templates by navigating through ** eBay Magento Connect**-> **Listing Templates**.

![image](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Listing-Templates-1.png)

Thus, the admin can add a template by entering the title, content of the template in **HTML** or **text**. The admin can enable or disable a template.

Here, the admin has mapped the **Magento Store Product Attributes** to the **Template variables** that are being used within the listing template.

Now, when the admin creates the listing templates these **template variables** can be used within the template to send the respective item description data.![magento2 ebay connector](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/webkul-magento2-ebay-connector-listing-template-title.png)

The admin can select product attributes and map them with the template variables so that the products can be exported to eBay with the listing template (item description).

After the products are imported you can see the template variable values on the product description and on the edit product page.![eBay Connector for Magento2](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/webkul-magento2-ebay-connector-template-description.png)

On the **edit** product page at **eBay,** you can see these values under the **Item Description** section.

![image](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Item-Description-1.png)

### Price Rule

This section will help the admin to create a price rule which will be applied to the eBay product. The admin needs to navigate through **Price Rule Tab** in eBay Magento Connect Tab.![price_rules_navigation](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/price_rules_navigation.png)

On Price Rules For the eBay page, the admin can create multiple rules by clicking on **Add Rule.** However, the admin can even **edit** the previous price rule.

![image](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/download-8-.png)

The price rule can be created by the admin by filling the following information-

- Product price From- Minimum price range of the products on which price rule will be applicable on eBay.
- Product price To- Maximum price range of the products on which price rule will be applicable on eBay.
- Operation Type- The admin can select the type of operation that will take place when price rule is applied that is if the price rule will follow the rule in the form of a percentage or fixed amount.
- Operation- The action that will take place when the price rule is applied, that is the price of the product will increase or decrease.
- Price- The admin can state here the amount which will be added or deducted from the product amount.
- Status– The admin can enable or disable the status of the price rule.

![image](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/download-9-.png)

## Application of Price Rule

**When Admin has set ‘*eBay Price Rule Applicable For*‘ Export Products-**

For instance, we have a price rule of increase in price at a fixed rate of $2 with a price range of $1-$30. On Magento end, we create a product with a price of $24 as below.

![image_eBay Connector for Magento2](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/download-18-.png)

Then as we export this product to eBay the price will automatically be incremented to $26 as per the rule.

[![eBay Connector for Magento 2](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/T-shirt-Polo-eBay.png)](https://webkul.com/blog/ebay-connector-for-magento2/t-shirt-polo-ebay/)

However, the same rule will act opposite if we import the same product from eBay to the Magento store.

***For example:*** If you have a product with $21 on eBay store and the price rule is set as of the increase in price at a fixed rate of $2 with a price range of $1-$30.

Now as we import the product to Magento store the price of the product at Magento end will be $19.

**When Admin has set ‘*eBay Price Rule Applicable For*‘ Import Products-**

Now the admin has the same price rule of increase in price at a fixed rate of $2 with a price range of $1-$30. The product is now on eBay at the price of $26 as given below.

![image_eBay Connector for Magento2](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/T-shirt-PoloXX-eBay.png)

Now, if the product gets imported the price of the product at the Magento store will be incremented by $2 as shown below.

![image](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/White-Tops.png)

Please notify here, the same rule will act opposite if we export the same product from eBay to Magento store.

For example, if you have a product with $26 and the price rule is set as of the increase in price at a fixed rate of $2 with a price range of $1-$30.

So as we import the product to eBay the price of the product at eBay end will be $24.

### Ebay Specification & Condition

At the time of Category mapping, eBay Product Condition and Specification will be created as Product attributes in Magento 2.

And these attributes label will be followed by eBay category name from where eBay condition and specification came.

**eBay-**

**Product Conditions**

**![image](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/ebay-product-conditions.png)**

**Specifications**

This option will come for every product in the back-end while editing or adding any new product. In eBay specification, admin can see various attributes with the label.

![ebay specificaitions](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/ebay-specificaitions.png)

### Map order

Before synchronizing the orders from eBay to Magento 2, make sure that all products and its categories are synchronized from the eBay store to Magento 2 store.

**1. Import Order from eBay**

The admin can import the orders from the eBay store.

![ebay-orders-import](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/ebay-orders-import.webp)

Here, the admin will click on “Import Order from eBay” tab, an eBay Order Range page will open as per the below image.

![image](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/IMPORT-ORDER.png)

The admin will enter the date range. Proceed by clicking on **Import Order from eBay** and then orders will be imported from eBay to Magento 2 store.

So, only those orders will be imported from **eBay **to ** Magento 2 **whose status is “**Complete”** on eBay.

![maped-ebay-order-list-process](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/maped-ebay-order-list-process.webp)

Thus, if the eBay Product is not synced with Magento 2 store then the system will show an error.

![ebay-not-synced-products](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/ebay-not-synced-products.webp)

**2. Run eBay Order Profiler**

![Run eBay Order profiler](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Map-eBay-Order.png)

Now, the admin will click on **Run eBay Order Profiler** and orders from eBay will be imported and admin can see how much orders are imported and how many orders are left.

![importing-orders-from-ebay](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/importing-orders-from-ebay.webp)

Hence the admin can get an error message if the eBay Order id is already mapped with Magento 2 Order id before running the profiler.

![ebay-already-maped-products](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/ebay-already-maped-products.webp)

So, post importing the orders from eBay to Magento 2 store, the grid will look as per the below image.

![products-sync-from-ebay](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/products-sync-from-ebay.webp)

**Note –**

- A cron is set which automatically imports the orders from the eBay store to Magento 2 store.  So, it also imports the products in the order, if they aren’t imported earlier.
- For the imported orders when the admin process the shipments in Magento, tracking information is automatically synchronized to the corresponding eBay order in real-time. However, vice versa is not possible.

### Real-Time Missed Order

So, the information about the orders is displayed which could not import in real-time due to missing address details.

![real-time-missed-orders-1](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/real-time-missed-orders-1.png)

### Grouped Product Export To eBay

The Grouped product created on Magento 2 store can be easily exported to eBay. So, this can be done post creation of the grouped product on Magento 2 Store.

![eBay Connector for Magento 2](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/download-12.png)

After this admin needs to go to **Map Product** option. Thus, this will open a page **Mapped Products List, **where the admin can select ** Export to eBay. **

![Ebay-Connector-blog-4](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Ebay-Connector-blog-4.png)

Thus, this export product can be seen on the eBay account under ** Sell>All selling.**

![image-eBay Connector for Magento2](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/My-eBay-All-Selling.png)

Hence, on clicking the respective product you can find the product details on product page.
